# Spark data directory


This directory is used to store data files related to Spark processing, such as:

    Input data for Spark jobs
    Output after Spark processing
    Spark temporary storage files


Note : Due to space considerations, large data files are not included in the repository. A small amount of example or test data may be included in the directory.
